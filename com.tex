\subsection{Computation Abstraction}
The computation abstraction is the core of a graph computing system. The
most popular computation abstraction is BSP model and GAS model.

\subsubsection{Bulk Synchronous Parallel Model}
The BSP model assumes that computation is done on multiple steps. A bulk contains
some subset of data, and a computation is done on these subset of data. After
computations, the output is used for synchronization.

For graph computing, Pregel makes the BSP model more specific.
Each vertex has two states: active and inactive, and computation
will only be conducted on active vertices. \fig{state} shows the
state machine of a vertex. Computations are done on multiple
supersteps. In the first superstep, all vertices is active and they
will vote to halt and convert to inactive. A vertex will be activate
when a message for the vertex is received.

In each superstep, a vertex get all messages sent to it and computes
result according to the current state of the vertex and sends messages
to its neighbors. \fig{bsp} shows the workflow of BSP.
