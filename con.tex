\section{Conclusion} \label{con}
In this paper, we have given a short summery of some popular graph computing
frameworks. We have conducted extensive evaluations for these frameworks
for analyze the performance gained in each techniques. Understanding
the effectiveness of each techniques and the design choices
make us better understand how to design a practical graph computing system.
