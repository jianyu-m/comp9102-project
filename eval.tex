\section{Evaluation}
The section shows the evaluation of several graph computing systems:
GraphX, GraphLab (PowerGraph) and Giraph.
We conduct the evaluations of these systems in a cluster with 4 machines.
Each machine is equipped with a Xeon CPU with 24 hyper cores.
We evaluate PageRank with 2 datasets, the datasets we used are showed in
\tab{dataset}.

\begin{table}[tbh]
  \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
    \textbf{Dataset Name} & \textbf{Vertex} & \textbf{Edges} \\
      \hline
      Youtube Network & 10k & 10m \\
      \hline
      Twitter Network & 1k & 1m
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Dataset.}
  \label{tab:dataset}
\end{table}

Our evaluations mainly focus on performance of these system and evaluates
Gigraph, SparkX and PowerGraph.
Our evaluations mainly answer the following questions:
\begin{tightenum}

\item[\S\ref{subsec:time}:] How much time needed for each framework
to converge a PageRank?

\item[\S\ref{subsec:scalability}:] Are these frameworks scalable to
large graphs or large number of machines?

\item[\S\ref{subsec:technique}:] Are the techniques in each framework
effective to provide fast computations?
\end{tightenum}
